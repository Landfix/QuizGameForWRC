  _content: "Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister\non the
    bank, and of having nothing to do:  once or twice she had\npeeped into the book
    her sister was reading, but it had no\npictures or conversations in it, `and
    what is the use of a book,'\nthought Alice `without pictures or conversation?'\n\n 
    So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could,\nfor the hot day
    made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether\nthe pleasure of making a daisy-chain
    would be worth the trouble\nof getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly
    a White\nRabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.\n\n  There was nothing so VERY
    remarkable in that; nor did Alice\nthink it so VERY much out of the way to hear
    the Rabbit say to\nitself, `Oh dear!  Oh dear!  I shall be late!'  (when she
    thought\nit over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have\nwondered
    at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);\nbut when the Rabbit actually
    TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-\nPOCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried
    on, Alice started to\nher feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never\nbefore
    seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to\ntake out of it,
    and burning with curiosity, she ran across the\nfield after it, and fortunately
    was just in time to see it pop\ndown a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.\n\n 
    In another moment down went Alice after it, never once\nconsidering how in the
    world she was to get out again.\n\n  The rabbit-hole went straight on like a
    tunnel for some way,\nand then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had
    not a\nmoment to think about stopping herself before she found herself\nfalling
    down a very deep well.\n\n  Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly,
    for she\nhad plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to\nwonder
    what was going to happen next.  First, she tried to look\ndown and make out what
    she was coming to, but it was too dark to\nsee anything; then she looked at the
    sides of the well, and\nnoticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves;\nhere
    and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs.  She\ntook down a jar from
    one of the shelves as she passed; it was\nlabelled `ORANGE MARMALADE', but to
    her great disappointment it\nwas empty:  she did not like to drop the jar for
    fear of killing\nsomebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as
    she\nfell past it."
